Just launched my new project – a TripAdvisor Clone Website! ✨
 
🚀 Built completely using **HTML5** and **CSS3** 
💻 Responsive layout using **Flexbox** 
📱 Mobile-first design with **@media queries** 
🎨 Smooth transitions with **@keyframes animation** 
🌍 Inspired by the real TripAdvisor layout – clean, modern & user-friendly

This project helped me improve my frontend development skills, especially in crafting responsive UI using just HTML and CSS.
